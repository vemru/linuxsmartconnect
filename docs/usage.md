## Feature status matrix

Tested with a motorola edge 60 stylus running Smart Connect 09.0.3.013, against niri 26.04 with
Noctalia Shell on Arch Linux. Other phones, app versions and desktops may behave differently.

### Connection
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pairing by QR code | ✅ | Scan a QR from the Smart Connect app; the PC then appears in the phone's device list. |
| Reconnect over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE | ✅ | The phone's Connect button, the daemon dialing the phone back over Wi-Fi (mDNS), and a Bluetooth LE wake that reaches the phone while Smart Connect is in the background. |
| Automatic reconnect | ✅ | After drops, at startup and after a failed Connect, with Smart Connect in the background on the phone (Bluetooth LE wake, about 5 to 6 s). Early retries (phone back on Wi-Fi, resume, network change, Bluetooth switched on) and dropping a dead session after 70 s of silence are unit-tested. A Disconnect from either side is respected. |
| Feature tiles for this PC on the phone | ✅ | App streaming, Cross Control, PC lock, Hotspot and Webcam. |
| PC lock tile | 🟡 | Locks through Noctalia's lock screen when it runs, else logind (GNOME under GDM, KDE, swayidle/hypridle lockers), or `--lock-command`. |
| Hotspot tile | 🟡 | Connects or disconnects using NetworkManager (`nmcli`). |

### Notifications, clipboard and messages
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phone notifications, quick reply, multi-line messages | ✅ | Through your desktop's notification daemon. Reply from a small window, the GTK app or the Noctalia panel. Chats show their recent messages, with sender names in groups. |
| Notification action buttons and "Open" | 🟡 | Action buttons (e.g. "Mark as read") run on the phone through a short background app-streaming session, without a window. |
| Notification dedupe, coalescing and themed icons | 🟡 | Prevents notification spam and shows native app/themed icons. |
| Per-app notification mute | 🟡 | A mute toggle on each notification and a *Muted apps* list, in the GTK app and the Noctalia plugin. |
| Clipboard text, both ways | ✅ | Password-manager copies are never sent to the phone. |
| Clipboard images and files | ❌ | Protocol reconstructed ([file-exchange.md](protocol/file-exchange.md), [clipboard.md](protocol/clipboard.md)). |
| SMS (read threads, send, mark read) | 🟡 | Control socket only, no UI yet. Needs enabling on the phone. |

### Mirroring and app streaming
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phone screen mirroring with mouse input | ✅ | Low-latency WebRTC mirroring. |
| Keyboard, phone keys and scrolling in the mirror window | 🟡 | Esc = Back, Ctrl+Alt+H = Home, Ctrl+Alt+R = Recents. |
| App streaming started from the PC | ✅ | Each phone app in its own Linux window (`smartconnect-mirror --app`). |
| App streaming from the phone's tile and the GTK app's *Apps* page | 🟡 | Select and launch apps directly from the desktop. |
| Real app icons for the *Apps* page | ✅ | Downloaded from the phone on every connection into `~/.cache/smartconnect-linux/app-icons/`. |
| App window resize | 🟡 | Opt-in (`SMARTCONNECT_MIRROR_RESIZE=1`): the phone resizes the app's virtual display to the window. |
| Screen share and Mobile desktop tiles | 🟡 | Shown by default. Mobile desktop has been started from the phone; Screen share is less tested. |

### Cross Control
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cross Control started from the PC | ✅ | The PC's mouse and keyboard glide onto the phone across a screen edge. |
| Cross Control started from the phone's tile | ✅ | Verified on GNOME. The tile arms shared mouse and keyboard. |
| Cross Control on GNOME | ✅ | Uses the InputCapture portal (asks for permission once) instead of wlr-layer-shell. Verified on GNOME 51. |
| Cross Control modes and a phone position editor | 🟡 | Shared mouse and keyboard, Duplicate display, Extend display; drag the phone to any side of the screen. |

### Phone as a display
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Extend | ✅ | The phone becomes a second monitor at the phone's resolution, placed to the right of your screens (`smartconnect-display --mode extend`). Verified with the phone on niri (vkms output), GNOME (Mutter virtual monitor), and Hyprland. |
| Duplicate | ✅ | Shows the focused screen on the phone (niri, GNOME, Hyprland verified; KDE, sway untested). |
| Display scale | ✅ | 200 % by default, the value Windows uses (`--display-scale`). |
| Keyboard button on the phone display | ✅ | Shows an on-screen keyboard ([wvkbd](https://git.sr.ht/~proycon/wvkbd)) on the shared screen. |
| Touch input | 🟡 | Tap = click, drag, long-press = right click, two-finger scroll. |
| Following the phone's rotation | 🟡 | Opt-in: `--follow-rotation`. |
| The PC's audio on the phone | 🟡 | Opt-in: `--audio`. |

### Webcam
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phone as a webcam | ✅ | `smartconnect-webcam`: the phone camera as a v4l2loopback device or a PipeWire camera. Switching between the front and back camera keeps the stream. 1280×720 at 30 fps, set by the phone. |
| Webcam quality and controls | ✅ | Configurable bitrate, mirror, flip, brightness, contrast, and quality via GTK GUI and tray menu. |

### Files
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Browse the phone's files (mount `/sdcard`) | ✅ | `smartconnect-files mount`: the phone's storage as a read-only FUSE folder over File Station (NFSv3 on mutual TLS). |
| Phone files in the GTK app & Noctalia panel | 🟡 | The *Files* page: Mount, Open in Files, Unmount, quick folders (Camera, Screenshots, Downloads, Documents). |
| Share a PC folder to the phone | ✅ | `smartconnect-files serve`, or *Share with the phone* on the GTK app's Files page: the phone browses a folder in Smart Connect's Files tab and Android's file browser. |
| Writing to the phone | 🟡 | Reverse-engineered; the NFS write path is not implemented yet. |

### Desktop app
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GTK app tray icon and background running | ✅ | A StatusNotifierItem with live status, webcam controls, window visibility, and connection state. |

## Ways to drive it

| Front-end | What it can do |
|---|---|
| The Smart Connect app on the phone | Pair (scan the QR), Connect, Disconnect, and the tiles on the PC's device page (App streaming, Cross Control, PC lock, Hotspot, Webcam). Starting the PC's screen on the phone. |
| GTK app (`smartconnect-gui`, **Smart Connect** in the app launcher) | A header **device menu** (left of the title) shows the connected device and holds *Pair new phone…*, *Preferences* (the *Start at login* switch) and *Connect/Disconnect*. A view switcher has five pages. *Phone*: a phone card (wallpaper, name, an inline battery / Wi-Fi / mobile / Bluetooth row, and **Mirror screen**), an unread-messages shortcut, and a Cross Control switch with an edge picker. While the phone is away the card keeps showing the last connected phone (dimmed last-known values, "last connected …") with a **Connect** button; with no phone paired it offers **Pair a phone**. If the Smart Connect service isn't running, the window says so, shows the last phone, and has a **Start service** button. *Apps*: a search box, Recent chips and an icon grid to stream single phone apps. *Display*: the phone as a second monitor or a copy of your screen (Layout / Experimental / Advanced groups). *Files*: mount the phone's storage, quick-folder shortcuts, and storage settings. *Notifications*: notifications grouped under *Today* with reply boxes, a ⋯ menu (*Open on phone*, *Dismiss*, *Mute app*) and per-app mute. Pairing opens in a dialog. In a narrow window the page switcher moves to the bottom. It also puts a [tray icon](#tray-icon-and-background-running) in the system tray and starts the daemon when you open it. |
| Noctalia plugin | Bar pill with battery level. Panel with the phone card (wallpaper, battery, signal, unread count), Connect/Disconnect, the pairing QR, Mirror screen, Cross Control with an edge selector, Phone as display with an Extend/Duplicate switch, a Phone files tile (mount, open, unmount), and recent notifications with reply boxes and mute buttons. Settings for the display, the phone files and the muted apps. An [IPC target](#noctalia-ipc) for keybindings. |
| CLI | `smartconnectd` with `status`, `subscribe`, `connect`, `disconnect` or `pair`, plus the helper programs. See the [reference](#command-line-reference). |
| Your own scripts | The [control socket API](control-socket-api.md). |

All desktop front-ends talk to the daemon over `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/smartconnectd.sock`, so they work
side by side.

## Running the daemon

Normally it runs as a systemd user service, which `packaging/install.sh --enable` sets up (see
[Installation](installation.md#the-systemd-user-service)):

```sh
systemctl --user enable --now smartconnectd
journalctl --user -u smartconnectd -f
```

For development or debugging, stop the service and run it in a terminal:

```sh
systemctl --user stop smartconnectd
RUST_LOG=debug smartconnectd --no-ble --name "Linux PC"
```

Started this way, it prints the pairing QR straight into the terminal. Two options exist for
protocol work and are off by default:

- `--session-log` records every frame exchanged with the phone in
  `~/.local/share/smartconnect-linux/sessions/`, with keys, tokens, passwords, clipboard, SMS and
  notification contents redacted (see [Security](security.md#session-logs)).
- `--extra-tiles SVC[=FLAGS],…` advertises extra feature tiles to the phone, for example
  `--extra-tiles 20` for the File explorer tile. Screen share and Mobile desktop are on by default.

To keep the flags under systemd, add them with a drop-in (`systemctl --user edit smartconnectd`,
see [Installation](installation.md#the-systemd-user-service)).

## Pairing

Status: ✅

1. Make sure the firewall allows TCP 52020 and mDNS ([Installation](installation.md#firewall)).
2. Get a QR code:
   - **GTK app:** the header **device menu**, then **Pair new phone…** (opens a dialog with the QR; **New code** refreshes it).
   - **Noctalia:** the QR button at the top of the panel.
   - **CLI:** `smartconnectd pair`, then open the SVG it names:
     `xdg-open ~/.local/share/smartconnect-linux/pairing-qr.svg`. A daemon running in a terminal
     also prints the QR there. Under systemd the terminal QR goes to the journal
     (`journalctl --user -u smartconnectd -o cat -n 60`).
3. On the phone, open **Smart Connect**, tap **+**, choose **Scan QR code**, and scan it.
4. The phone connects, and the PC appears in its device list under the name from `--name` (the
   systemd unit uses `Linux PC`). Without `--name`, the hostname is used.

Things to know:

- A QR stays valid for `--token-ttl` seconds: 180 by default, 600 in the systemd unit. The daemon
  renders a fresh one when it expires, so an open QR window can go stale. Ask for a new one if a
  scan fails.
- The QR lists the PC's private IPv4 addresses. Docker, libvirt, VPN and similar interfaces are
  skipped. If the phone tries the wrong address, start the daemon with `--ip <address>` (repeat it
  for several).
- Right after the first pairing, the new device entry on the phone can show "offline" with a
  Connect button even though the session is up. That is the phone app's ordering, not a failure.
  About 5 s later the daemon asks the phone to reconnect, which fixes it, provided it has seen the
  phone's mDNS advert. Otherwise tap **Connect** once.
- **Pairing again** after removing the PC on the phone works the same way: scan a fresh QR. The
  daemon repeats the key exchange whenever the phone doesn't start it, so the entry comes back.
- **One phone at a time.** The daemon can store several paired phones, but connection state is
  shared, so only one phone is expected to be connected.
- **Unpairing:** remove the PC in the Smart Connect app. To make the PC forget the phone as well,
  stop the daemon and delete that phone's entry from `~/.local/share/smartconnect-linux/paired.json`,
  or reset everything with `./packaging/uninstall.sh --purge`. Deleting `cert.pem`/`key.pem` changes
  the PC's certificate fingerprint, and every paired phone then has to pair again.

## Connecting and disconnecting

Status: ✅ (Wi-Fi reconnect, Bluetooth LE wake, automatic reconnect)

**From the phone:** tap **Connect** or **Disconnect** on the PC's entry in Smart Connect. Connect
finds the PC over mDNS and asks it for an invite, then the phone dials the PC.

**From the desktop:** the Connect/Disconnect button in the GTK app or the Noctalia panel, or:

```sh
smartconnectd connect      # prints {"message":"…","ok":true|false}
smartconnectd disconnect
```

A desktop Connect first tries Wi-Fi: it pushes an encrypted invite to the phone's own discovery
endpoint, using the last address the phone advertised over mDNS. That endpoint only listens while
Smart Connect is open on the phone. If it fails, the daemon scans for the phone over Bluetooth LE
for up to 30 s, writes the same invite to it, and the phone then connects over Wi-Fi. This works
with the app in the background, and is how the genuine Windows PC does it: a backgrounded phone app
has no Wi-Fi listener at all and never reconnects to a PC by itself. It takes about 5 to 6 s.
Bluetooth must be on on both devices; the daemon never switches the PC's adapter on (or off) by
itself, and with Bluetooth off on the PC a backgrounded phone reconnects only when you open Smart
Connect on it. Only one Connect runs at a time: pressing the button while the daemon is already
reconnecting waits for that attempt. If a desktop Connect doesn't get through, the daemon keeps
trying in the background (below).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Connect<br/>(desktop or auto-reconnect)"] --> B{"phone's mDNS endpoint known<br/>and reachable?"}
  B -- yes --> C["send sealed invite over Wi-Fi"]
  B -- no --> D["scan Bluetooth LE for the phone (≤ 30 s)"]
  D -- found --> E["write sealed invite over GATT"]
  D -- not found --> F["error: phone not found over Bluetooth"]
  C --> G["phone dials wss://PC:52020/readyfor/"]
  E --> G
```

**Automatic reconnect.** If a session drops without a Disconnect, 8 s after the daemon starts, and
after a desktop Connect that didn't get through, the daemon keeps trying Connect until the phone is
back. It waits 2, 5, 15, 30 and 60 s between attempts and then every 5 minutes; while the phone
still answers on the LAN (Smart Connect merely in the background) it retries at least once a minute
for the first 15 attempts. It also tries straight away when:

- the phone's mDNS advert appears (Smart Connect opened on the phone);
- the phone answers on Wi-Fi again after being away (checked every 30 s with a single TCP
  connection attempt to its last address, no Bluetooth needed);
- this PC wakes from suspend, or gains a LAN address (Wi-Fi back, new network);
- Bluetooth is switched on on this PC.

The daemon follows the PC's LAN addresses, so invites carry the current ones after a network change
(unless `--ip` pins them). A session that goes silent for 70 s (the phone answers WebSocket pings
every 20 s) is treated as dead and dropped, which starts the reconnect loop; before, a phone that left
Wi-Fi could look connected for many minutes.

**Disconnect is respected.** After a Disconnect from either side, the daemon stops reconnecting on
its own. The next Connect from either side ends that state.

## Tray icon and background running

Status: 🟡 (implemented; needs a system-tray host, which the Noctalia/Quickshell bar provides).

The GTK app puts a StatusNotifierItem in the system tray. Its icon follows the state — daemon not
running, starting, phone disconnected, phone connected — and its tooltip spells it out. Left-click
shows or hides the window; right-click opens a menu with **Show/Hide Window**, **Connect**,
**Disconnect** and **Quit**.

- **Closing the window hides it to the tray** instead of quitting. The daemon and any streams keep
  running; reopen from the tray (or by launching the app again).
- **Opening the app starts the daemon** if it isn't already running. It prefers the
  `systemctl --user` unit when that is installed, otherwise it runs `smartconnectd` itself. The
  window shows *Starting smartconnectd…* until the control socket answers.
- **Quit** (tray menu only) leaves the app *and* stops the daemon — the systemd unit with
  `systemctl --user stop smartconnectd`, or the `smartconnectd` the app started as a child. A daemon
  you started by hand (e.g. in a terminal) is left running.
- **Start at login:** the switch on the *Phone* page adds or removes
  `~/.config/autostart/dev.smartconnect.Linux.desktop` (`Exec=smartconnect-gui --background`), so the
  app comes up at login hidden to the tray, with the daemon started. You can also run
  `smartconnect-gui --background` yourself.

If the desktop has no system-tray host, the app still runs with just its window (and the tray is
simply absent).

## Phone status

Status: 🟡

The phone pushes its battery level and charging state, Wi-Fi and mobile signal, Bluetooth state,
unread message count and wallpaper. The GTK app's *Phone* page and the Noctalia bar and panel show
them, and `smartconnectd status` prints them as JSON (field reference in the
[control socket API](control-socket-api.md#the-status-object)). They are kept in memory only. The
wallpaper is saved to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/smartconnectd/phone-wallpaper.jpg` (or `.png`).

## Clipboard

Status: ✅ text both ways · ❌ images and files

- Copy text on the phone and it is placed on the Linux clipboard (`wl-copy`).
- Copy text on Linux and it is sent to the phone (`wl-paste --watch`; on GNOME, which lacks the
  data-control protocol, through Xwayland).
- Copies that a password manager marks as sensitive are never sent to the phone.
- Text longer than 100,000 characters is cut to that length.
- When you copy files or screenshots on the phone, the daemon logs them as unsupported and ignores
  them.

This needs `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` in the daemon's environment, and either a compositor with the
data-control protocol or (GNOME) Xwayland with `DISPLAY` set (see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#clipboard-doesnt-sync)).

## Notifications

Status: ✅ mirrored to the desktop, quick reply, multi-line messages ·
🟡 action buttons, "Open on phone", dedupe/coalescing, themed icons, per-app mute

Notifications the phone forwards appear through your desktop notification daemon. They update in
place when the phone updates them and close when they are dismissed on the phone. The phone decides
which apps it forwards.

- **Multi-line messages:** for chat notifications the body shows up to the last 4 messages. In group
  conversations each line is prefixed with the sender. Bodies are cut at 600 characters.
- **Quick reply** (✅): if the app supports replies, the notification gets a **Reply** button (it is
  also the default click action). It opens a small reply window: type, press Enter to send, Esc to
  cancel. The GTK app's *Notifications* page and the Noctalia panel also show reply boxes under
  replyable notifications. The reply goes back through the app's own reply action on the phone.
- **Action buttons** such as "Mark as read" or a timer's "Pause" (🟡): the phone carries these out
  through app streaming. It asks the PC to stream the app and fires the action once the app is up
  on its own virtual display. The stream host (`smartconnect-mirror --host`, which the daemon keeps
  running) answers that request **without opening a window** and closes the stream again a few
  seconds later, after the phone reports that the app is up. Set
  `SMARTCONNECT_BACKGROUND_ACTIONS=0` in the daemon's environment to get a window instead.
- **Open on phone** (🟡): clicking a notification that can't be replied to — or *Open on phone* in the
  GTK app's **⋯** menu — opens that app in its own window on the PC through
  [app streaming](#app-streaming), as on Windows.
- **Dedupe and coalescing** (🟡): identical re-posts are dropped, and a notification that keeps
  changing (progress bars, timers, calls) updates the desktop at most once per second.
- **App icons** (🟡): the phone's own launcher icon from the app-icon cache
  (`~/.cache/smartconnect-linux/app-icons/`) when it has been downloaded, else an icon from your
  theme matching the app's name or package (searched in `~/.local/share/icons`, Papirus, hicolor,
  breeze, Adwaita), else the phone's monochrome glyph. Big pictures and callers' pictures appear as
  the notification image. Chat notifications (WhatsApp and similar) show the app icon: the phone
  sends only your own picture with them, never the sender's.
- **Per-app mute** (🟡): a muted app produces no desktop popups. Its notifications still appear in
  the GTK app and the Noctalia panel.
  - **GTK app:** a notification's **⋯** menu has *Mute app* (and *Unmute* once muted). The *Muted apps*
    list at the top of the *Notifications* page has an **Unmute** button per app.
  - **Noctalia:** the bell-off button on a notification in the panel (highlighted while muted), and
    *Settings → Muted apps* with **Unmute** buttons.
  - **Control socket:**

    ```sh
    S=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/smartconnectd.sock
    echo '{"cmd":"notif_mute","pkg":"com.example.app","mute":true}' | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:$S
    echo '{"cmd":"notif_mute","pkg":"com.example.app","mute":false}' | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:$S
    echo '{"cmd":"notif_mute"}' | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:$S          # list muted packages
    ```

  The list lives in the daemon (`~/.local/share/smartconnect-linux/notif-mute.json`), so every
  front-end shows the same one. The package name of each recent notification is the `pkg` field in
  `smartconnectd status`, and `smartconnect-mirror --list-apps` lists all apps.
- Notifications with custom layouts (some media players) carry no usable text and are skipped.

## SMS

Status: 🟡 backend only, needs enabling on the phone, not verified

There is no UI yet. Use the control socket commands `sms_threads`, `sms_thread`, `sms_send`,
`sms_mark_read` and `sms_state` (see the [API reference](control-socket-api.md#sms-commands)).

```sh
S=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/smartconnectd.sock
echo '{"cmd":"sms_threads"}' | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:$S      # starts a sync, returns what is cached
sleep 5
echo '{"cmd":"sms_threads"}' | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:$S      # conversations, newest first
echo '{"cmd":"sms_send","number":"+15555550123","text":"On my way"}' | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:$S
```

The phone only answers once Messages is enabled for this PC. The first sync sends the "PC ready"
message, which enables it once the phone allows it; Smart Connect also needs SMS permission on the
phone. `sms_state` shows the phone's answer in `usable` (`enabled`, `granted`). Messages are kept in
memory only and cover what the phone sends, about the last 10 days.

## Screen mirroring

Status: ✅ video and mouse input · 🟡 keyboard, phone keys and scrolling

Start it with:

- **GTK app:** *Phone* page, then **Mirror screen** (the button changes to **Stop mirroring**).
- **Noctalia:** **Mirror screen** in the panel.
- **CLI:** `smartconnect-mirror`. When a stream host is running (the daemon starts one after the
  phone connects), the viewer hands the request to the host and exits, and the window belongs to
  the host.

The phone may ask for permission to share its screen. The window is titled
"Phone — Smart Connect".

Input in the mirror window:

| On the PC | On the phone |
|---|---|
| Mouse move, left/right/middle button | Pointer and clicks at that spot |
| Mouse wheel | Scroll |
| Mouse "back" side button | Back |
| `Esc` | Back (`Shift+Esc` sends a real Escape) |
| `Ctrl+Alt+B` | Back |
| `Ctrl+Alt+H` | Home |
| `Ctrl+Alt+R` | Recents (app switcher) |
| Other keys (`Ctrl+C`/`V`/`A`, `Alt+Tab`, arrows, F-keys, …) | Sent as real key presses (PC scancodes, US layout) |

Super combinations are usually taken by your compositor. Keyboard input only works when the video
window runs under XWayland: the viewer uses X11 automatically when `DISPLAY` is set, because
GStreamer's native Wayland GL window gets no keyboard events.

To stop, close the window, use the Stop button, or press Ctrl+C in the terminal you started it from.
The session also ends if the connection to the phone is lost for more than 5 s.

The video goes directly between the phone and this PC over UDP. The PC offers the phone only the
address the phone already reached it on (the daemon's `pcAddress`), so Docker, VPN and other
interfaces aren't tried; set `SMARTCONNECT_ICE_ADDRESSES` to override that (see
[environment variables](#environment-variables)). Only H.264 is decoded (VA-API when available,
otherwise libav). See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#mirroring-and-app-streaming).

## App streaming

Status: ✅ apps started from the PC · 🟡 apps started from the phone's tile or the GTK app's *Apps*
page · 🟡 window resize

Each phone app opens in its own Linux window, titled after the app (for example
"Calculator — Phone"). On the phone, each streamed app runs on its own virtual display.

- **From the PC:**

  ```sh
  smartconnect-mirror --list-apps            # pkg, userId, name, component (tab-separated)
  smartconnect-mirror --app com.example.calculator
  smartconnect-mirror --sessions             # JSON list of open streams
  smartconnect-mirror --close <sessionId>
  ```

  `--app` goes through the stream host if one is running. Otherwise it streams from its own process
  and exits when its windows close.
- **GTK app:** *Apps* page. **Load Apps** fetches the list (cached in
  `~/.cache/smartconnect/apps.json`), search it, and click an app to open it. Running streams are
  listed with Close buttons. The page starts a stream host if none is running.
  - **App icons** (🟡): the page shows the phone's own icon when it is in
    `~/.cache/smartconnect-linux/app-icons/`. The daemon downloads all of them from the phone on
    every connection (✅ verified on a device; it takes about a second; `SMARTCONNECT_APP_ICONS=0`
    turns it off), and the stream host also saves the icon the phone sends with a stream. To
    download them now, run `smartconnect-fex fetch-app-icons`. Otherwise it uses a
    desktop icon only when one matches exactly (the package name, or an installed app with exactly the
    same name), and else the app's initials. New icons appear on their own; **Refresh** looks again.
    The same icons are used for Recent, running streams and notifications.
- **From the phone:** tap the **App streaming** tile on the PC's device page and pick an app on the
  phone. The daemon keeps a stream host (`smartconnect-mirror --host`) running while a phone is
  connected, and that host answers the phone's request.

Input in app windows uses the same code as the mirror window, but hasn't been verified separately.
Closing a window ends that app's stream. Window icons aren't set yet.

**Window resize** (🟡, opt-in): with `SMARTCONNECT_MIRROR_RESIZE=1` in the daemon's environment (or
a host started as `smartconnect-mirror --host --resize`), resizing an app window asks the phone to
resize that app's virtual display to match, once the new size has held for a moment. It is off by
default because tiling compositors resize every new window right away, so each app would ask the
phone for a new size as soon as it opens. The whole-screen mirror is never resized.

## Screen share and Mobile desktop tiles

Status: 🟡 shown by default; Mobile desktop started from the phone, Screen share less tested

The phone has two more tiles for a PC: **Screen share** (the phone's screen, or a "virtual phone",
in a PC window) and **Mobile desktop** (Ready For's desktop mode in a PC window). The daemon
advertises both by default.

Tapping a tile and then **Connect** on the phone makes the phone ask the PC to show that view; the
stream host answers, and the view opens in a window titled "Phone — Smart Connect",
"Virtual phone — Smart Connect" or "Mobile desktop — Smart Connect". The phone may ask you to
allow streaming first. The phone keeps the advertised tiles until the next connection made without
the flag.

From the PC, `smartconnect-mirror --desktop` asks the phone for the Mobile desktop view directly
(through the stream host when one runs).

## Cross Control

Status: ✅ started from the PC · ✅ started from the phone's tile (GNOME) · 🟡 position editor and
the three-mode page are new

Cross Control has three modes, as on Windows:

| Mode | What it does | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| **Shared mouse and keyboard** | The PC's mouse and keyboard move onto the phone across a screen edge. | `smartconnect-crosscontrol` |
| **Duplicate display** | The phone shows this PC's screen. | a [phone as display](#phone-as-an-external-display) session in Mirror mode |
| **Extend display** | The phone becomes a second screen. | a phone as display session in Extend mode |

1. Start a mode:
   - **GTK app:** the top of the **Display** tab (also reachable from Cross Control on the *Phone*
     page). Click a mode to start it, click it again to stop it; starting one stops the other. The
     display settings that Duplicate and Extend use are further down the same tab.
   - **Noctalia:** **Cross Control** in the panel (shared mouse and keyboard); the arrow button
     next to it cycles the edge. Duplicate and Extend are the panel's display button.
   - **CLI:** `smartconnect-crosscontrol` (shared mouse and keyboard), or
     `smartconnect-display --mode mirror|extend`.
   - **Phone:** tap the **Cross Control** tile. The daemon arms shared mouse and keyboard
     (`smartconnect-crosscontrol --accept` if no client runs), and the GTK app, if running, comes
     forward on its Display tab so you can switch to Duplicate or Extend.
2. For shared mouse and keyboard, push the pointer into the phone's edge of the screen. The phone
   may ask you to allow control the first time.
3. Your mouse now moves a pointer on the phone, and your keyboard types on it. Where the compositor
   supports it, desktop shortcuts are inhibited while you control the phone.
4. To come back, push the pointer back out past the shared edge (with no button held), or press
   **Ctrl+Alt+Esc**. To enter again right away, give a small outward push inside the edge.
5. Stop it from the same page or button, or Ctrl+C. It tells the phone it is done.

### Phone position

On the Display tab (*Phone position*), drag the phone around the picture of your monitors — it draws
them where the desktop has them (sidebar above laptop, side by side, offset…). The phone snaps to a
*free* edge of the monitor you drop it on (an edge no other monitor sits against; the ones that are
shared are skipped, because the pointer cannot leave the desktop there). The highlighted part of that
edge is where the pointer crosses over, and it maps onto the whole height (or width) of the phone.
**Extend display** puts the phone's screen beside that same monitor, centred on the phone, past any
other monitor on that side, and every existing monitor keeps the position it had. A running Extend
session follows when you drop the phone (`smartconnect-display --side` overrides the side).
**Duplicate display** shows that monitor on the phone. The position is saved in
`~/.config/smartconnect-linux/crosscontrol.json`
(`{"edge": "left", "start": 0.15, "end": 0.85, "output": "eDP-1", "rect": [250, 1440, 1920, 1080]}`:
fractions along that monitor's edge from the top or the left, and the monitor the phone touches plus
its logical rect — the portal has no output names, so the rect is how the barrier finds the right
monitor). A file without `output`/`rect` keeps working: the primary monitor is used.
`smartconnect-crosscontrol` reads it when it starts, also when the daemon starts it for the phone's
tile. Moving the phone while shared mouse and keyboard runs restarts the client to apply it.
`--edge` and `--span START:END` override the file, and so does `$SMARTCONNECT_CROSS_EDGE` for
clients the daemon starts.

Only one client runs at a time. Starting a new one takes over from the old one.

Two ways to grab the mouse and keyboard, picked automatically (`--backend` overrides it):

- **layer-shell** (niri, sway, Hyprland, KDE): a 1-pixel strip on the edge plus a pointer lock.
  Pointer constraints, relative pointer and shortcut inhibiting are used when available. Tested on
  niri.
- **portal** (GNOME): the desktop's InputCapture portal puts a barrier on that edge of every
  monitor (only along the phone's part of it) and hands the mouse and keyboard to the client while
  you're on the phone. The first start asks you to allow input capture; the answer is remembered.
  Verified on GNOME 51 with a phone.

Options are listed in the [reference](#smartconnect-crosscontrol).

## Feature tiles on the phone

Status: ✅

On connect, the daemon tells the phone which features this PC offers, and the phone draws tiles for
them on the PC's device page: **App streaming**, **Cross Control**, **PC lock**, **Hotspot** and
**Webcam**, **Screen share** and **Mobile desktop** (see
[above](#screen-share-and-mobile-desktop-tiles)). A tile only does something if its PC-side
handler is available:

| Tile | Handled by |
|---|---|
| App streaming | The stream host, which the daemon starts after the phone connects. |
| Cross Control | A running `smartconnect-crosscontrol`, or one the daemon starts on demand. |
| PC lock | The daemon (Noctalia's lock screen, `loginctl lock-session`, or `--lock-command`). |
| Hotspot | The daemon (`nmcli`). |
| Webcam | `smartconnect-webcam --answer`, which the daemon starts on demand. If it can't be started, the phone shows its "install the PC camera driver" message. |
| Screen share, Mobile desktop | The stream host. |

Showing the PC's screen on the phone is picked with the Cross Control modes at the top of the GTK
app's Display tab (the phone's Cross Control tile brings it forward); see also [Started from the phone](#started-from-the-phone).

The stream host, Cross Control and the phone display are only started when the daemon has
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` or `DISPLAY` in its environment. The webcam helper needs neither.

## PC lock

Status: 🟡 not yet re-tested on a device

Tap the **PC lock** tile and the daemon locks the screen:

- with Noctalia's lock screen, when Noctalia is running;
- else with `loginctl lock-session` on your graphical session. GNOME (under GDM) and KDE react to
  that, and for other lockers the idle daemon does (swayidle with a `lock` handler, or hypridle's
  `lock_cmd`);
- or with your own command: `smartconnectd --lock-command 'swaylock -f'` (run with `sh -c`).

The phone's tile shows "locked" only once the daemon sees logind's `LockedHint` turn true (or, for
Noctalia and `--lock-command`, once the command succeeds). When the hint turns false again the tile
resets. If nothing locks, the tile resets right away and the PC shows a notification saying why.

GNOME started from a display manager other than GDM (SDDM, LightDM) has no lock screen at all:
GNOME Shell only creates it under GDM, so neither the tile nor Super+L can lock it. Logging in
through GDM is the only fix.

## Hotspot

Status: 🟡 not verified

Tap the **Hotspot** tile on the phone. The PC picks a network name (`SmartConnect-XXXX`) and a random
16-character WPA2 passphrase, the phone starts its hotspot with them, and the PC joins with `nmcli`
(5 attempts). When the phone stops the hotspot, the PC deletes that connection profile so
NetworkManager returns to your usual network. Joining the hotspot moves the PC off its current
network, and the PC's address changes with it. The daemon only learns its addresses at startup, so
restart it if the phone can't reconnect afterwards.

## Phone as an external display

Status: ✅ Extend · ✅ Duplicate · ✅ display scale · ✅ keyboard button ·
🟡 GTK and Noctalia controls · 🟡 keyboard height · 🟡 touch input · 🟡 following the phone's
rotation · 🟡 audio · 🟡 started from the phone

`smartconnect-display` shows the PC's screen in Smart Connect's full-screen display view on the
phone, and turns your touches on the phone into pointer input on the PC. The daemon must be running
and the phone connected.

- **Extend** (✅): the phone becomes a second monitor at the stream size and scale, placed to the
  right of your other screens (they keep their positions), and removed again when the session
  ends. How the screen is made depends on the desktop (detected automatically; set
  `SMARTCONNECT_DESKTOP=gnome|kde|hyprland|sway|niri` to override):

  | Desktop | The phone's screen | Input | Status |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | GNOME | a Mutter virtual monitor (no extra packages, no dialog) | Mutter RemoteDesktop | ✅ verified on GNOME 51, without a phone session yet |
  | Hyprland | a headless output (`hyprctl output create headless`), captured with wlr-screencopy | virtual pointer | ✅ verified on Hyprland 0.56 (nested), without a phone session yet |
  | niri | a spare output switched on: the first `Virtual-*` from [vkms](installation.md#vkms-for-extending-the-desktop-onto-the-phone), or an HDMI dummy plug | virtual pointer | ✅ verified with the phone |
  | sway | a headless output (`swaymsg create_output`), wlr-screencopy | virtual pointer | ❓ untested |
  | KDE Plasma | a KWin virtual output (screencast protocol); needs the `.desktop` file `install.sh` installs | KWin fake input | ❓ untested |
  | other Wayland | none: name a connected spare output with `--output` | virtual pointer | ❓ untested |

  **Which side:** the phone's screen goes where you put the phone on the GTK app's Cross Control
  page (a free side of any of your monitors, centred on the spot you dropped it, past a monitor that
  is already on that side; every other monitor keeps its position; saved in
  `~/.config/smartconnect-linux/crosscontrol.json`), else on the right of the primary one. A running
  session follows a change within a second (GNOME, niri, Hyprland, sway; KDE places it itself).
  `--side left|right|top|bottom` overrides it for one session.

  `--output NAME` uses an existing connector (e.g. an HDMI dummy plug) instead on every desktop.
  `smartconnect-display --list-outputs` prints what the helper sees.
- **Duplicate** (✅, `--mode mirror`): shows the monitor the phone sits next to (the Cross Control
  position, else the primary/focused one), without a picker on GNOME, niri (Mutter screencast API),
  KDE (KWin) and Hyprland/sway (wlr-screencopy). When that fails it falls back to the
  xdg-desktop-portal screen picker, which asks once and remembers the choice.

### Starting and stopping

The command line is verified with a phone. The GTK and Noctalia controls (🟡) were tested against a
stand-in helper only.

- **GTK app:** the *Display* tab. Click *Duplicate display* or *Extend display* in the Cross
  Control modes at the top; **Stop** (or clicking the mode again) ends the session. The header shows what is happening ("Streaming 2712×1220 to the phone", "Extended onto
  Virtual-1", or why the last session ended). When you change a setting while a session runs,
  **Apply Changes** restarts it with the new settings. The page also checks the setup and says what
  is missing: on niri no virtual output (with the `sudo modprobe vkms` command to copy), a desktop
  that can't add a screen, the chosen output unplugged, or no `wvkbd` (not needed on GNOME).
  It lists the screens through `smartconnect-display --list-outputs`. Closing the window doesn't stop the session.
- **Noctalia:** **Phone as display** in the panel (it becomes **Stop phone display**), with a button
  next to it that switches between Extend and Duplicate. The display settings are under the
  plugin's *Settings*. For keybindings:
  `qs -c noctalia-shell ipc call plugin:smart-connect display toggle` (see [Noctalia IPC](#noctalia-ipc)).
- **CLI:**

  ```sh
  smartconnect-display --mode extend --size native   # the phone becomes a second monitor
  smartconnect-display --mode mirror                 # duplicate the focused screen
  ```

  Stop it with Ctrl+C. With no options it uses the saved settings (below).
- **From the phone:** see [Started from the phone](#started-from-the-phone).

Stopping from any of these, or from the phone, closes the phone's display view and switches an
extend output off. Only one session runs at a time: a second `smartconnect-display` refuses to start
("already running (pid N)") unless you pass `--replace`, which stops the running one first. The GTK
app and the plugin find a session however it was started (terminal, the other front-end, or the
daemon) and can stop it.

If the process is killed hard (SIGKILL or a crash), the phone's screen can stay: on niri run
`niri msg output Virtual-1 off`, on Hyprland `hyprctl output remove SMARTCONNECT-1`, on sway
`swaymsg output HEADLESS-N unplug`. GNOME and KDE remove their virtual screen by themselves when the
process dies.

### Settings

The GTK *Display* page and the Noctalia settings write the same file,
`~/.config/smartconnect-linux/display.json`, and `smartconnect-display` reads its defaults from it,
so a session started from the phone or a terminal uses the same choices. Command-line options
override the file; `--no-config` ignores it and `--config PATH` reads another file.

```json
{"mode":"extend","size":"native","displayScale":2.0,"oskHeight":45,"output":null,
 "audio":false,"followRotation":false}
```

| Key | Option | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `--mode` | `extend` or `mirror` (Duplicate). Without the file the default is `mirror`; the GTK app and the plugin start with `extend`. |
| `size` | `--size` | `native` (the phone's own panel in landscape, e.g. 2712x1220, nothing letterboxed), `requested` (what the phone asks for, usually 1920x1080; the helper's default) or `WxH`. The GTK app calls these *Phone native*, *Phone default* and *Custom*, and remembers a choice per mode. |
| `displayScale` | `--display-scale` | Extend: the virtual monitor's scale, 0.5 to 4 or 50 % to 400 % (`1.5`, `150%`). Default 2 (200 %, the value Windows uses); a larger scale means bigger text and less room. The front-ends offer 100 % to 300 %. |
| `oskHeight` | `--osk-height` | Height of the on-screen keyboard in % of the shared screen, 15 to 80 (default 45). |
| `output` | `--output` | Extend: `null`, `""` or `auto` for the first `Virtual-*` output, or a connector name such as `HDMI-A-1`. The GTK app has it under *Advanced → Extend onto*. |
| `audio` | `--audio`, `--no-audio` | Send the PC's audio (default off). |
| `followRotation` | `--follow-rotation`, `--no-follow-rotation` | Extend: follow the phone's rotation (default off). |
| `bitrate` | `--bitrate` | Stream quality in kbit/s, 500 to 50000 (default 8000). The GTK app offers 2, 4, 8 and 16 Mbit/s. Lower sends less data per frame, which can cut the picture's delay on a busy Wi-Fi. |
| `fps` | `--fps` | Most frames per second sent, 10 to 60 (default 60). The GTK app offers 15, 30 and 60. |

Unknown keys are ignored, and a bad value is skipped with a warning, so the file never stops a
session from starting.

### Touch input

Status: 🟡. Tap = left click, drag = drag, long-press = right click, two-finger drag = scroll.
Mouse and keyboard input from the phone side is forwarded too. Input reaches the PC through
Wayland's virtual-pointer and virtual-keyboard protocols and is pinned to the shared screen. Taps
on the [on-screen keyboard](#keyboard-button) reach the PC; the other gestures haven't been checked
on a device.

### Keyboard button

Status: ✅ · 🟡 keyboard height

The keyboard button in the phone's display toolbar shows the PC's on-screen keyboard on the shared
screen, as Windows does, so it appears on the phone and you type by tapping it. Press the button
again to hide it. This needs [wvkbd](https://git.sr.ht/~proycon/wvkbd) (AUR `wvkbd`; the first of
`wvkbd-deskintl` and `wvkbd-mobintl` found on `PATH` is used). Without it you get a desktop
notification with a hint.

The keyboard takes `--osk-height` percent of the shared screen's height (default 45, like a phone
keyboard), with large keys and a number row. To use a different on-screen keyboard, set
`SMARTCONNECT_OSK` to its command line (split on spaces, no shell quoting); `--osk-height` doesn't
apply to it.

### Following the phone's rotation

Status: 🟡 opt-in, not verified on a device

With `--follow-rotation` (or *Rotate with the phone*), turning the phone upright turns the extend
output portrait in place, so an upright phone shows a full-height desktop instead of a letterboxed
landscape picture, and back again. Windows on the output stay where they are. Portrait streams are
limited to 1920 pixels tall (`SMARTCONNECT_DISPLAY_PORTRAIT_MAX` changes the limit, `0` removes it).
Duplicate ignores rotation. Without the option, an upright phone shows the landscape picture
letterboxed.

### Audio

Status: 🟡 opt-in, not verified on a device

With `--audio` (or *Send PC audio to the phone*), what the PC plays (the default output's monitor)
is sent to the phone as Opus, and the audio switch in the phone's display toolbar mutes and unmutes it.
The sound keeps playing on the PC too, with the phone slightly behind. If the PC's audio can't be
captured, the session starts without it and you get a notification.
`SMARTCONNECT_DISPLAY_AUDIO_SRC` replaces the capture with your own GStreamer source description.

### Started from the phone

Status: 🟡 not verified on a device

When you start showing the PC's screen from the phone, the daemon starts
`smartconnect-display --mode <the mode the phone asks for>`; every other choice comes from
`display.json`. If a session is already running, that one answers instead. If the helper can't start
or fails within 20 s, the daemon tells the phone to stop waiting. The helper's output goes to
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/smartconnectd/smartconnect-display.log`.

### More

- When the phone asks for a different resolution, Extend resizes the output in place and the
  stream keeps going. This was only tested with a simulated request.
- As for mirroring, only the address the phone reached the PC on is offered for the video
  (`SMARTCONNECT_ICE_ADDRESSES` overrides it).
- `--test-pattern` sends a moving test picture instead of the screen, to check the phone side
  without touching your desktop. All options are in the [reference](#smartconnect-display).

## Phone as a webcam

Status: ✅ verified on a phone (including switching between the front and back camera); the quality
setting is 🟡 not verified yet

`smartconnect-webcam` makes the phone's camera available as a Linux webcam. The phone streams H.264
over WebRTC straight to the helper, which decodes it to 1280x720 YUY2 at 30 fps. The frames go to a
`v4l2loopback` device, so every V4L2 app sees a camera, or, when no loopback device exists, to a
PipeWire camera node named "Phone Camera (Smart Connect)".

- **From the phone:** tap the **Webcam** tile. The daemon starts `smartconnect-webcam --answer`,
  which logs to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/smartconnectd/smartconnect-webcam.log`.
- **From the desktop (GTK App & Noctalia Panel):**
  - **GTK App (`smartconnect-gui`):** The Phone page includes a **Phone as webcam** row. Click **Start webcam** to begin streaming. Once active, quick action buttons appear to **Switch camera** (front/back) and **Toggle torch**. Stream quality can be configured in Preferences.
  - **Noctalia Panel:** Includes a **Webcam** quick-settings action tile. Click to toggle the webcam stream, or tap the chip option to flip the camera.
  - **App launcher action:** Right-click the Smart Connect launcher icon to select **Start Webcam**.
- **From the CLI:**

  ```sh
  smartconnect-webcam --check            # where frames would go, and a GStreamer element check
  smartconnect-webcam --test-pattern 10  # 10 s of test pattern into the output, no phone needed
  smartconnect-webcam                    # start the phone camera; Ctrl+C or --stop ends it
  smartconnect-webcam --switch-camera    # also: --torch, --zoom N, --cameras, --pause, --resume
  ```

- **Quality:** the phone always sends 1280x720 at 30 fps in this mode; no command changes the
  resolution or frame rate, so 60 fps isn't possible. What the PC controls is the bitrate the phone
  may encode at: `--quality low|medium|high|max` (1.5, 4, 8 or 15 Mbit/s at most; default `high`).
  Sessions the daemon starts from the phone's tile read it from
  `~/.config/smartconnect-linux/webcam.json`:

  ```json
  {"quality": "max"}
  ```

  The phone may cap the bitrate below the chosen maximum.
- **Switching cameras** on the phone, or with `--switch-camera`, keeps the stream: the phone re-sends
  its start message after a switch, and the helper keeps the running session instead of answering
  again.
- Only one webcam session runs at a time. Start the webcam before the app that should use it: many
  apps only list cameras when they start, and with `exclusive_caps=1` the loopback device only
  appears as a camera while a session streams.
- The helper only ever writes to virtual (loopback) video devices, never to a real camera.
- For a camera that every app sees, load v4l2loopback first (this needs root; making it permanent
  is described in [Installation](installation.md#v4l2loopback-for-the-phone-as-a-webcam), and
  `smartconnect-webcam --check` prints the same commands):

  ```sh
  sudo modprobe v4l2loopback devices=1 video_nr=10 card_label="Phone Camera" exclusive_caps=1
  ```

  Without it, the camera is only offered as a PipeWire camera, which only PipeWire-aware apps see.
  All options are in the [reference](#smartconnect-webcam).

## Browsing the phone's files

With `smartconnectd` running and the phone connected, mount the phone's storage as a read-only folder:

```sh
smartconnect-files mount --mountpoint ~/Phone   # creates the folder if needed
# in another terminal: browse and read
ls ~/Phone
# when done: Ctrl+C in the first terminal (or SIGTERM), or from another terminal:
fusermount3 -u ~/Phone
```

`smartconnect-files mount` runs in the foreground until the mount is released. Ctrl+C, SIGTERM and
SIGHUP unmount cleanly (lazily if a shell is still inside the folder). It uses the phone's own
**File Station** protocol: it performs the `cmd=1001` handshake through the daemon, then speaks
**NFSv3 over fingerprint-pinned mutual TLS** to the phone — no root, no adb. `smartconnect-files list`
does the handshake and prints the export root without mounting. The mount is **read-only** for now;
writing to the phone is not implemented yet. Needs `fuse3`
installed. (For offline testing you can pass `--ip`/`--mount-port`/`--nfs-port`/`--fp` to skip the
handshake.)

**Phone away, daemon restarted** (🟡): the mount stays up. When the phone disconnects (Wi-Fi drop,
sleep, the daemon restarting), files calls fail at once with an I/O error instead of hanging, and the
helper waits for the daemon to report the phone connected again, redoes the handshake (the phone's
NFS ports change every session) and carries on — open folders keep working. It only gives up, and
unmounts, after 10 minutes without the phone or when the phone is unpaired. A stale mount left at the
folder by a helper that was killed ("Transport endpoint is not connected") is cleared before mounting.

### From the GTK app

The **Files** page in the GTK app wraps the same helper, so you don't need a terminal:

1. With the phone connected, open the **Files** page and press **Mount** on the storage card. The app
   creates the mount folder, starts `smartconnect-files mount` in the background and shows
   *Mounting…* while it handshakes with the phone.
2. Once mounted the card shows a *Read-only* badge, **Open in Files** (opens the folder in your file
   manager) and **Unmount** (runs `fusermount3 -u` and stops the helper). A **Quick folders** row
   gives one-click shortcuts to Camera, Screenshots, Downloads and Documents when those folders exist.
3. If the phone isn't connected the **Mount** button is disabled; if the mount fails (for example the
   phone dropped mid-handshake) the page shows the helper's error in a banner and returns to the
   unmounted state.
4. The page checks that the mount is really alive, not just that the folder is a mount point. **Open
   in Files** (and the quick folders) check first: while the phone is away it says so; a stale mount
   (its helper died) is cleared and mounted again, then opened. A stale mount found while mounted or
   at startup is cleared on its own, and with **Mount automatically when connected** it is mounted
   again.

The mount folder defaults to `~/Phone`; change it under **Storage → Mount location → Change…** (while
nothing is mounted) and the app remembers it in `gui.json`. Turn on **Mount automatically when
connected** to mount as soon as the phone connects. Closing the window to the tray keeps the mount
running; **Quit** unmounts it first, so no stale mount is left behind.

### From the Noctalia panel

The panel has a **Phone files** tile that wraps the same helper:

1. With the phone connected, open the Smart Connect panel and tap the **Phone files** tile. It
   creates the mount folder, starts `smartconnect-files mount` in the background and the option chip
   shows *Mounting…* while it handshakes with the phone.
2. Once mounted the chip becomes a clickable **Open** (opens the folder in your file manager) and the
   tile itself becomes **Unmount** (runs `fusermount3 -u` and the helper exits).
3. The tile is greyed out until the phone is connected; if the mount fails (for example the phone
   dropped mid-handshake) the panel's status line shows the helper's error and the tile returns to
   its unmounted state.

The mount folder defaults to `~/Phone`; change it (and the helper path) under **Phone files** in the
plugin settings. Unlike the GTK app, the plugin does **not** unmount on panel close or shell exit —
the mount persists like a phone-as-display session. The tile reflects the folder itself, not just the
helper process: opening the panel adopts a live mount it didn't start (so it can be opened and
unmounted) and clears a stale one (its helper died, for example when the whole shell exited).
**Open** checks the mount first — it remounts a stale one and then opens it, and says in the status
line when the phone is offline or the folder couldn't be opened. This needs `fuse3` (`fusermount3`),
like the CLI and the GTK app.

## Sharing a PC folder to the phone (phone browses the PC)

This is the mirror of the mount above: the **PC shares a folder** (by default `~/SmartConnect`)
and the **phone browses it** in Smart Connect's **Files** tab and in Android's file browser.
Nothing is copied to the phone; it reads a folder listing, a thumbnail or a file only when you
open it. `~/SmartConnect` is created on first use; pick another folder with *Change…* or
`--sharedir`. Symlinks inside the shared folder are hidden from the phone, which sees only real
files and folders inside the share.

### Sharing files from your file manager (context menu)

Select one or more files or folders in your file manager (Nautilus, Dolphin, Nemo, or desktop) and share them directly to the phone:

- **Nautilus (GNOME Files):** Right-click selected file(s) → **Scripts** → **Send to Phone (Smart Connect)** (or right-click → **Open With…** → **Send to Phone (Smart Connect)**).
- **KDE Dolphin:** Right-click selected file(s) → **Send to Phone (Smart Connect)**.
- **CLI:** `smartconnect-share <file1> <file2> ...`

Files are hardlinked (or copied if across devices/directories) into `~/SmartConnect` (or your configured shared folder) without duplicating disk space, and `smartconnect-files serve` is activated in the background so the files appear immediately on the connected phone under Smart Connect's **Files tab**. A desktop notification confirms the transfer.

**From the GTK app:** Files page → *Share with the phone* → turn on *Share a folder with the phone*.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| *Shared folder* (Change…) | `~/SmartConnect` | The folder the phone sees. The open button shows it in your file manager. |
| *Include hidden files* | off | Show files and folders whose names start with a dot (`~/.ssh`, `~/.config`, …). Off keeps them invisible to the phone: not listed, not openable, not deletable. |
| *Let the phone delete files* | on | Deleting in the phone's Files tab moves the file to your desktop **Trash**, so you can restore it. Off makes the share fully read-only. |

The choices are remembered. The share starts whenever the phone connects, restarts if the daemon
restarts, and stops on Quit (closing the window to the tray keeps it). The status row says whether
the phone has connected. If the phone hasn't connected 15 s after being told the address, the row
points at the firewall.

**On the phone:**

- **Smart Connect → Files tab → Files → "<PC name>".** *All files* shows the shared folder (folders
  first). *Recents*, *Images*, *Videos*, *Documents*, *Audio* and *Downloads* search the whole
  shared folder, newest first (*Recents* = changed in the last 30 days; *Downloads* =
  `Downloads/` in the shared folder). Images and videos have thumbnails. Videos need `ffmpeg` on
  the PC. The first search of a big shared folder can take a few seconds.
- **Android's file browser** (any app's "open file" or "attach" button) lists the share as
  **"<PC name> <PC IP>"**.
- The phone can open and copy files out, and delete them (to your Trash, unless turned off). It
  can't create, rename or change files on the PC.

**From the command line**, with `smartconnectd` running and the phone connected:

```sh
smartconnect-files serve                       # share ~/SmartConnect
smartconnect-files serve --sharedir ~/Public   # or another folder
# Ctrl-C to stop sharing
```

`smartconnect-files serve` runs in the foreground until Ctrl-C or SIGTERM. It answers the phone's
`cmd=1001` File Station handshake through the daemon and serves the folder over **NFSv3 on
fingerprint-pinned mutual TLS** (the **SSL** transport; the native QUIC tunnel is not implemented),
including the Lenovo procedures the Files tab uses. Options:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--sharedir DIR` | The folder to share (default: `~/SmartConnect`; created if missing). |
| `--include-hidden` | Also show hidden (dot) files and folders. |
| `--read-only` | Refuse deletions too (by default they move files to the Trash with `gio trash`). |
| `--label /NAME` | The export name the phone sees (default: the folder's name, e.g. `/alice`). |
| `--port 2049` | The TLS listener port. |
| `--ip ADDR` | The PC address sent to the phone (default: the daemon's `pcAddress`). |

The phone connects to the PC for this, so the port has to be open: inbound TCP 2049, or your
`--port`, in the [firewall](installation.md#firewall) zone of your Wi-Fi. The listener is on all
interfaces. A running `nfs-server` already holds 2049; pass another `--port` then. While `serve`
runs, the paired phone can read everything visible under the shared folder (see
[Security](security.md#network-exposure)).

> **Status:** verified on a phone: listing the folder and subfolders, opening files, the Files tab
> (All files and the category views), image and video thumbnails, and delete-to-Trash. Not tried
> yet: very large folders.

## Sending a link or a file from the phone (phone → PC)

The phone's share sheet and **File explorer** can send a link, some text or a file to the PC.
Nothing opens or runs on arrival: the daemon shows a GNOME notification titled **Smart Connect**
with the content visible, and the action you pick goes through the desktop portal (the same
native chooser and app picker every other app uses).

- **Link or text:** the notification shows the link/text with **Open** and **Dismiss**. Only
  `http://` and `https://` links get an Open button; anything else (`file:`, `javascript:`,
  `smb://`, …) is shown as text and can never be launched. Open asks the portal which app to use
  (`Open With` dialog, no default-app guessing) and never opens anything by itself.
- **File or folder:** the notification shows the name and size with **Open**, **Save as…** and
  **Dismiss**. *Open* on a file hands the staged copy to the portal so you pick the app; *Open* on a
  folder opens it in your file manager (the portal has no app picker for folders) and keeps the
  staged copy for a day so the window doesn't go empty. *Save as…* opens the native save dialog with
  the received name (sanitized) preselected under `~/Downloads`; a folder is saved as a folder
  (`FileChooser.SelectFolder` when the portal has it, otherwise a `SaveFile` dialog whose chosen
  name becomes the folder).

While a share is pending the copy lives in a private directory under
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/smartconnectd/shares/` (mode 0700). It is deleted on **Dismiss**, after a
successful **Open**/**Save as…** (except a folder you opened, kept for a day), when a newer share
replaces it, or after 30 minutes without an action. Files are capped at 256 MiB. The notification
stays in GNOME's message tray until you act on it.

Received files arrive in the phone's zip transport and are unpacked only into the staging
directory, with traversal and symlink protection, never directly into `~/Downloads`.

This needs `xdg-desktop-portal`; on GNOME that is `xdg-desktop-portal-gnome` (usually installed).
Without a portal, Open falls back to `xdg-open`/`gio open` and Save to `zenity`, and the daemon
logs which path it used. Shares are accepted only from the paired, connected phone, and
notification actions are rate-limited.

> **Status:** the notification and the OpenURI, FileChooser (SaveFile, and the SaveFile fallback
> for a missing SelectFolder) and OpenDirectory portals are verified against GNOME Shell 50.6 on
> Wayland: the dialogs open and are closed through the portal, and Escape sent to the focused
> Open With dialog cancels it. GNOME logs `Failed to associate portal window with parent window`
> for the daemon's empty parent, so raising the dialog above the current window is up to the
> shell. The share frame is implemented from the documented service 2 `FileExSendData` carrier
> and tested with simulated shares; it has not yet been captured from a real phone's share
> button.

## Not supported

- ❌ Writing to the other side's storage: the phone's storage is read-only on the PC, and the
  phone can't create or change files in a shared PC folder (it can only delete them to the Trash).
- ❌ Sending files from the PC to the phone (one-shot push), and files or images on the clipboard.

## Command-line reference

### `smartconnectd`

```
smartconnectd [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
```

Without a command it runs the daemon. With a command it sends that command to the running daemon
over the control socket and prints the JSON reply.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--port <PORT>` | `52020` | TCP port of the TLS WebSocket the phone connects to. It must be open in the firewall. |
| `--ip <IP>` | auto | LAN address to put in pairing QRs and invites. Repeat for several. Default: every private IPv4 address except on container, VM and VPN interfaces. |
| `--name <NAME>` | hostname | Name the phone shows for this PC. Saved in `identity.json`. |
| `--state-dir <DIR>` | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/smartconnect-linux` | Identity, certificate, pairings, pairing QR and session logs. A different directory is a different PC to the phone. |
| `--token-ttl <SECONDS>` | `180` | How long a pairing QR (invite token) stays valid. |
| `--light-terminal` | off | Draw the terminal QR for a light-background terminal. |
| `--no-ble` | off | Don't start the experimental Bluetooth LE peripheral. Without this flag the daemon powers on the Bluetooth adapter at startup, advertises itself over BLE and puts the adapter's address in the QR. Pairing doesn't need any of that, and the systemd unit passes `--no-ble`. It doesn't affect the Bluetooth wake used by Connect (see `--no-ble-wake`). |
| `--no-ble-wake` | off | Never use Bluetooth LE to wake the phone for a (re)connect. The wake only runs while the PC's Bluetooth is already on and never changes the adapter's power. With this flag a phone whose Smart Connect app is in the background reconnects only when you open the app. |
| `--extra-tiles <SVC[=FLAGS],…>` | none | Experimental: extra feature tiles to advertise to the phone, as service ids, optionally with flags (0–255, default 1). `--extra-tiles 20` adds the File explorer tile (Screen share and Mobile desktop, service 1, are on by default). A service that isn't also in the daemon's `serviceVersions` gets a warning, because its tile won't show. |
| `--session-log` | off | Record every frame exchanged with the phone under `<state dir>/sessions/`, for protocol debugging. Keys, tokens, passwords, clipboard, SMS and notification contents are redacted. |
| `--lock-command <CMD>` | none | Command (run with `sh -c`) that locks the screen for the PC lock tile. Without it: Noctalia's lock screen when Noctalia runs, else `loginctl lock-session` on the graphical session. |
| `-h`, `--help` / `-V`, `--version` | | Print help or the version. |

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `status` | Print the phone status as one JSON line. |
| `subscribe` | Print the status, then the full status again on every change, until Ctrl+C. |
| `connect` | Connect to the paired phone now (Wi-Fi, then Bluetooth LE). Usually a few seconds; at worst about a minute (two 30 s Bluetooth scans). If it fails, the daemon keeps retrying in the background. |
| `disconnect` | Close the current session and stay disconnected until the next Connect. |
| `pair` | Make a fresh pairing QR. Prints the SVG path. |

### `smartconnect-mirror`

```
smartconnect-mirror [--host [--resize] | --desktop | --app PKG [CMP] | --list-apps [--json]
                     | --sessions | --close SID]
```

| Mode | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(no arguments)* | Mirror the whole phone screen. Handed to the stream host if one runs. |
| `--host` | Long-running stream host. It opens a window for every stream the phone starts here (notification Open, the App streaming, Screen share and Mobile desktop tiles), runs notification action buttons without a window, serves `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/smartconnect-mirror.sock` (see [API](control-socket-api.md#the-stream-host-socket)), and refuses to start twice. The daemon keeps one running. |
| `--host --resize` | The same, and ask the phone to resize app displays to their windows (experimental; also `SMARTCONNECT_MIRROR_RESIZE=1`). |
| `--desktop` | Ask the phone for Ready For's Mobile desktop in a window (experimental). Handed to the host if one runs. |
| `--app PKG [CMP]` | Stream one app, optionally a specific activity component. Goes through the host if one runs. |
| `--list-apps [--json]` | Ask the phone for its launchable apps. Prints `pkg`, `userId`, `name`, `cmp` tab-separated, or one JSON array with `--json` (each entry also has `iconName`, the app icon's file name in the icon cache, and `work` for work-profile apps). Caches the list in `~/.cache/smartconnect/apps.json` and falls back to the cache if the phone doesn't answer within 15 s. |
| `--sessions` | Print the host's open sessions as JSON. |
| `--close SID` | Close one host session. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Usage. |

| Environment variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SMARTCONNECT_BACKGROUND_ACTIONS=0` | Notification action buttons open a window, like Open does, instead of running in the background. |
| `SMARTCONNECT_MIRROR_RESIZE=1` | Same as `--resize` for a host. |
| `SMARTCONNECT_ICE_ADDRESSES` | Local addresses offered to the phone for the video: comma-separated IPs and IPv4 CIDRs (`192.168.1.20,10.0.0.0/8`), or `all`. Default: the daemon's `pcAddress`, else private IPv4 addresses on non-virtual interfaces. |
| `MIRROR_DECODER` | GStreamer H.264 decoder element. Default `vah264dec` if available, else `avdec_h264`. |
| `MIRROR_SINK` | Video sink. Default `glimagesink` if available, else `autovideosink`. |
| `MIRROR_GL_WAYLAND=1` | Keep GStreamer's native Wayland GL window instead of X11/XWayland (no keyboard input). |
| `GST_GL_WINDOW` | Respected if you set it. Otherwise the viewer sets `x11` when `DISPLAY` exists. |

The host the daemon starts inherits the daemon's environment, so set these for the service (see
[Installation](installation.md#the-systemd-user-service)).

### `smartconnect-crosscontrol`

```
smartconnect-crosscontrol [--edge left|right|top|bottom] [--span START:END] [--backend auto|layer-shell|portal]
                          [--output NAME] [--gain 1.6] [--exit-px 12] [--no-in-use-cap] [--accept]
```

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--edge` | from `crosscontrol.json`, else `right` | The screen edge the phone "sits" behind. |
| `--span START:END` | from `crosscontrol.json`, else `0:1` | The part of the edge the phone touches, as fractions from the top or the left. Only there does the pointer cross over, and it maps onto the phone's whole side. |
| `--backend` | `auto` | How input is grabbed: `layer-shell` (edge strip + pointer lock), `portal` (InputCapture portal, GNOME), or `auto` (layer-shell when the compositor has it, else the portal). |
| `--output NAME` | from `crosscontrol.json`, else the primary | The monitor the phone sits next to. Layer-shell uses that output's edge; the portal arms only the barrier segment on that monitor's rect (edges shared between two monitors are refused by the desktop). |
| `--gain N` | `1.6` | Pointer speed on the phone: relative mouse motion × N, in phone pixels. |
| `--exit-px N` | `12` | How far (in phone pixels) to push back past the shared edge to return to the PC. |
| `--no-in-use-cap` | off | Don't send the phone the "Cross Control in use" status update. |
| `--accept` | off | Request control right away. The daemon uses this when the phone asked first (tile tap). |

Ctrl+Alt+Esc returns control to the PC. Ctrl+C (or SIGINT/SIGTERM) tells the phone to stop and
exits.

### `smartconnect-display`

```
smartconnect-display [--mode mirror|extend] [--output NAME|auto]
                     [--size WxH|native|requested] [--display-scale N] [--osk-height PCT]
                     [--audio|--no-audio] [--follow-rotation|--no-follow-rotation]
                     [--test-pattern [--pattern NAME]] [--scale N] [--x264] [--bitrate KBPS]
                     [--config PATH|--no-config] [--replace]
```

Defaults come from `~/.config/smartconnect-linux/display.json` (see [Settings](#settings)); the
defaults below apply when the file doesn't set a value.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--mode` | `mirror` | `mirror` duplicates the focused output. `extend` gives the phone a screen of its own (see the table above) and shows that on the phone. |
| `--output NAME`, `--output auto` | a new screen (niri: first `Virtual-*`) | For extend: an existing output to use instead, e.g. `HDMI-A-1` for a dummy plug. |
| `--side SIDE` | the Cross Control placement, else `right` | For extend: `left`, `right`, `top` or `bottom` of the main screen. |
| `--list-outputs` | | Print the desktop, how Extend works there and its outputs as JSON, then exit. |
| `--size WxH`, `native`, `requested` | `requested` (usually 1920x1080) | Stream size. `native` uses the phone's own panel size in landscape. |
| `--display-scale N` | `2` | For extend: the virtual monitor's scale, from 0.5 to 4 (or `50%` to `400%`). |
| `--osk-height PCT` | `45` | Height of the on-screen keyboard (wvkbd) in % of the shared screen, 15 to 80. |
| `--audio`, `--no-audio` | off | Also send what this PC plays to the phone (experimental). |
| `--follow-rotation`, `--no-follow-rotation` | off | For extend: turn the phone's monitor portrait or landscape with the phone (experimental). |
| `--test-pattern`, `--pattern NAME` | `ball` | Send a moving GStreamer test pattern instead of the screen (no input injection). `smpte` shows the frame edges. |
| `--scale N` | `100` | Scale percentage reported to the phone (Windows DPI style). This doesn't change the PC's own scaling. |
| `--x264` | off | Force the software encoder. The default is `vah264enc` when available. |
| `--bitrate KBPS` | `8000` | Encoder bitrate. |
| `--config PATH`, `--no-config` | `display.json` | Read defaults from another file, or from none. |
| `--replace` | off | Stop a running `smartconnect-display` first, instead of refusing to start. |

Ctrl+C (SIGINT or SIGTERM) ends the session. The last WebRTC offer and answer are written to
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/smartconnect-display.{offer,answer}.sdp`.

| Environment variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SMARTCONNECT_OSK` | Command line of the on-screen keyboard for the phone's keyboard button (default: `wvkbd-deskintl`, else `wvkbd-mobintl`). |
| `SMARTCONNECT_ICE_ADDRESSES` | As for [`smartconnect-mirror`](#smartconnect-mirror). |
| `SMARTCONNECT_DISPLAY_PORTRAIT_MAX` | Tallest portrait stream with `--follow-rotation` (default 1920, `0` = no limit). |
| `SMARTCONNECT_DISPLAY_AUDIO_SRC` | GStreamer source description used for `--audio` instead of the default output's monitor. |
| `SMARTCONNECT_DISPLAY_DEBUG_RESIZE=WxH` | Testing: act as if the phone asked for that resolution 15 s into the session. |
| `SMARTCONNECT_DISPLAY_DEBUG_ROTATE=1\|2` | Testing: act as if the phone turned landscape (1) or portrait (2) 15 s into the session. |

### `smartconnect-webcam`

```
smartconnect-webcam [--start | --stop | --check | --test-pattern [SECONDS]
                     | --switch-camera | --torch | --zoom N | --cameras]
                    [--output auto|v4l2|pipewire|none] [--device /dev/videoN] [--size WxH]
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--start` (default) | Ask the phone to start its camera and serve it as a webcam until stopped (Ctrl+C, `--stop`, or Stop on the phone). |
| `--answer` | Answer the phone's own request (its Webcam tile). The daemon runs this. |
| `--stop` | Stop the running webcam session. |
| `--check` | Show where frames would go and how to set up v4l2loopback. |
| `--test-pattern [S]` | Feed a test pattern to the output for S seconds (default 10), no phone needed. |
| `--switch-camera`, `--torch`, `--zoom N`, `--cameras` | Front/back camera, the phone's light, zoom level (0 = none), and the phone's camera state. |
| `--pause`, `--resume` | Pause camera stream, or resume camera stream. |
| `--output` | `auto` (default): v4l2loopback when present, else PipeWire. `none` decodes only. |
| `--device /dev/videoN` | A specific loopback device. Real cameras are refused. |
| `--size WxH` | Output size (default 1280x720). |

Environment variables: `SMARTCONNECT_WEBCAM_OUTPUT` and `SMARTCONNECT_WEBCAM_DEVICE` (defaults for
`--output` and `--device`), `SMARTCONNECT_WEBCAM_DECODER` (H.264 decoder element) and
`SMARTCONNECT_WEBCAM_FORMAT` (output pixel format, default `YUY2`).

### `smartconnect-files`

```
smartconnect-files fingerprint [--state-dir DIR]
smartconnect-files list  [--path /sdcard] [--state-dir DIR]
smartconnect-files mount --mountpoint DIR [--path /sdcard] [--state-dir DIR]
smartconnect-files serve [--sharedir DIR] [--include-hidden] [--read-only] [--label /NAME] [--port 2049] [--ip ADDR] [--state-dir DIR]
```

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `fingerprint` | Print the SHA-256 fingerprint of this PC's File Station TLS certificate (the `fp` sent in the `cmd=1001` handshake), creating the certificate on first use. |
| `list` | Handshake with the phone through the daemon and print the export root (default path `/sdcard`). See [Browsing the phone's files](#browsing-the-phones-files). |
| `mount` | Mount the phone's storage read-only at `--mountpoint` (required; the GTK app and the plugin pass `~/Phone` by default). Runs until Ctrl+C, SIGTERM or SIGHUP, or `fusermount3 -u DIR`. |
| `serve` | Share `--sharedir` (default: `~/SmartConnect`) with the phone as an NFSv3-over-TLS server on `--port` (default 2049, all interfaces; open it in the [firewall](installation.md#firewall)). Hidden (dot) entries stay invisible unless `--include-hidden`; deleting from the phone moves files to the Trash unless `--read-only`. `--label` is the name the phone sees (default: the folder's name), `--ip` overrides the PC address sent to the phone. Runs until Ctrl-C or SIGTERM; meanwhile the phone lists this PC in Smart Connect's Files tab (`cap` `"206"`). Remembers the phone's certificate in `<state dir>/phone-fps`. See [Sharing a PC folder](#sharing-a-pc-folder-to-the-phone-phone-browses-the-pc). |
| `-h`, `--help` | Usage. |

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--state-dir DIR` | Where the TLS identity lives (default `~/.local/share/smartconnect-linux/files-identity/`). |
| `--path P` | The phone-side path to list or mount (default `/sdcard`). |
| `--ip`, `--mount-port`, `--nfs-port`, `--fp` | `list` and `mount`, for offline testing: use this phone address, MOUNT port, NFS port and certificate fingerprint instead of handshaking through the daemon. All four are needed. |

Every command except `fingerprint` needs a running daemon with the phone connected.
`RUST_LOG=smartconnect_files=debug` logs more; `SMARTCONNECT_FILES_TRACE=1` also hex-dumps the
NFS traffic of `serve` in both directions.

### `smartconnect-fex`

Client for the phone's "fex" file-transfer server. The daemon already uses the same code to
download the app icons on every connection; this command is for doing it by hand and for testing.

```sh
smartconnect-fex fetch-app-icons                 # ask the phone for its app list, download the icons
smartconnect-fex fetch-app-icons --out /tmp/icons --phone 192.168.1.30
smartconnect-fex pull --host 192.168.1.30 --port 50000 --fingerprint <hex> [--token <token>] --out DIR
```

- `fetch-app-icons` needs a running daemon with a connected phone. It sends service 17 `cmd 2` through
  the control socket, waits (`--timeout`, default 30 s) for the app list, downloads the icon zip and
  writes each PNG to `--out` (default `~/.cache/smartconnect-linux/app-icons/`) under the phone's
  `iconName`, then prints e.g. `fetched <n> icons into … (<written> written, <unchanged> unchanged, 0 skipped)`. The
  phone's address comes from the daemon's `phoneAddress` unless you pass `--phone`. It holds the
  icon lock while it runs, so the daemon leaves that offer to it.
- `pull` downloads any offer whose port, fingerprint (and token) you already have, and unpacks it
  into `--out`. Offers are one-shot and expire quickly.
- `RUST_LOG=smartconnect_fex=debug` shows every frame.

### `smartconnect-gui`

```
smartconnect-gui [--background]
```

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--background` | Start hidden: no window, only the [tray icon](#tray-icon-and-background-running). Used by the *Start at login* autostart entry. Launching the app again (without the flag) shows the window. |

The application ID is `dev.smartconnect.Linux`. It finds the daemon and the helpers it starts the
same way the daemon does ([Installation](installation.md#how-the-programs-find-each-other)) —
`$SMARTCONNECT_SMARTCONNECTD_BIN`, then next to `smartconnect-gui`, then `PATH` — and keeps its own
preferences in `~/.config/smartconnect-linux/gui.json`.

### Noctalia IPC

The plugin registers the IPC target `plugin:smart-connect` for keybindings:

```sh
qs -c noctalia-shell ipc call plugin:smart-connect toggle            # open the panel
qs -c noctalia-shell ipc call plugin:smart-connect connect
qs -c noctalia-shell ipc call plugin:smart-connect disconnect
qs -c noctalia-shell ipc call plugin:smart-connect mirror            # start or stop the mirror viewer
qs -c noctalia-shell ipc call plugin:smart-connect display toggle    # phone as display on/off
qs -c noctalia-shell ipc call plugin:smart-connect display start     # also: stop
qs -c noctalia-shell ipc call plugin:smart-connect display extend    # also: duplicate
```

`display extend` and `display duplicate` save that mode and start a session, restarting a running
one that uses the other mode. Drop `-c noctalia-shell` if Noctalia is your default Quickshell
configuration.

### Environment variables

Read by `smartconnectd`. The helpers it starts inherit its environment, so their variables (marked
*helper*) can be set for the service too.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RUST_LOG` | Log filter (default `info`). `debug` shows more detail. |
| `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` | Needed for Linux-to-phone clipboard sync and for starting helpers. |
| `DISPLAY` | Also lets helpers start. |
| `SMARTCONNECT_HELPERS=0` | Don't start the stream host, Cross Control, the phone display or the webcam helper automatically. |
| `SMARTCONNECT_APP_ICONS=0` | Don't download the phone's app icons when it sends its app list. |
| `SMARTCONNECT_MIRROR_BIN`, `SMARTCONNECT_CROSSCONTROL_BIN`, `SMARTCONNECT_DISPLAY_BIN`, `SMARTCONNECT_WEBCAM_BIN` | Full path of a helper to start, instead of the one next to `smartconnectd` or on `PATH`. The GTK app reads them too. Any `SMARTCONNECT_<NAME>_BIN` works the same way: the program's name without `smartconnect-`, in capitals. |
| `SMARTCONNECT_FILES_BIN` | Full path of the `smartconnect-files` the GTK app's *Files* page starts (the daemon doesn't start it). |
| `SMARTCONNECT_SMARTCONNECTD_BIN` | Full path of the `smartconnectd` the GTK app starts when it can't use the systemd unit, instead of the one next to `smartconnect-gui` or on `PATH`. |
| `SMARTCONNECT_CROSS_EDGE` | Edge used when the phone's tile starts Cross Control, overriding the saved phone position (`crosscontrol.json`). |
| `SMARTCONNECT_BACKGROUND_ACTIONS=0` | *helper:* notification action buttons open a window. |
| `SMARTCONNECT_MIRROR_RESIZE=1` | *helper:* resize app displays to their windows. |
| `SMARTCONNECT_ICE_ADDRESSES` | *helper:* addresses offered for video (mirror, app streaming, phone display). |
| `SMARTCONNECT_OSK` | *helper:* on-screen keyboard for the phone display's keyboard button. |
| `SMARTCONNECT_FILES_TRACE=1` | `smartconnect-files serve`: hex-dump the NFS traffic (debugging). |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` | Base directories for state, settings, caches, and sockets and runtime files. |

### Files

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/.local/share/smartconnect-linux/` | State (mode 0700): `identity.json`, `cert.pem`, `key.pem`, `paired.json`, `pairing-qr.svg`, `phone-endpoints.json`, `notif-mute.json`, `screencast-token`, and `sessions/` with `--session-log`. See [Security](security.md#data-on-disk). |

| `~/.cache/smartconnect/` | Phone app list (`apps.json`) and the stream host log when the GTK app started it. |
| `~/.cache/smartconnect-linux/app-icons/` | Phone app icons: `<iconName>` downloaded by the daemon (or `smartconnect-fex`) on each app list, and `<pkg>.png` saved by the stream host. Safe to delete; the next connection downloads them again. |
| `~/.local/state/smartconnect-linux/` | GTK app: the last connected phone (`last-device.json`, `last-wallpaper.*`). |
